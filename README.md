# Personal Website

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for my personal website, which serves as an online portfolio and showcases my projects and skills. The website is designed using modern web technologies and follows responsive design principles to ensure an optimal viewing experience on different devices.

## Tech Stack
The website is built using the following technologies:

- Bootstrap 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery

## Custom APIs
To maintain data privacy and security, all custom APIs have been hosted on Vercel as a separate project and are set to private access. These custom APIs serve specific purposes and provide seamless integration with the website.

1. **Custom API for Fetching Leetcode Profile Data**: This API retrieves data from the Leetcode platform and displays relevant information on the website. It shows the total number of problems solved, along with the individual problems solved, including their titles and dates of completion.

2. **Custom API for Visitor Tracking and Analytics**: The visitor tracking API records and analyzes the number of visitors accessing the website, along with their geographical locations. This helps me gain insights into user engagement and improve the overall user experience.

Please note that due to security considerations, the custom APIs are not publicly accessible. If you have any questions or would like to know more about the website's functionalities, feel free to reach out to me.
